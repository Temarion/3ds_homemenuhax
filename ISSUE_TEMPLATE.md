**menuhax is obsolete, see https://3ds.hacks.guide/ instead.**

Before creating an issue, please make sure that you:
* Properly extracted the *latest* release-archive to your SD card. https://github.com/yellows8/3ds_homemenuhax/releases/latest
* *Read* the entire README.
* **Actually READ the displayed text from menuhax_manager.**

~~Note that HTTPC errors are normally due to user-side network fail(unless there's *really* server-side issues). Verify that [this](https://yls8.mtheall.com/) and [this](https://smealum.github.io/ninjhax2/) are accessible from your network.~~

If you're getting an error from menuhax_manager, include the log *file* from SD '/3ds/menuhax_manager/menuhax_manager.log' with this issue, as already described in the menuhax_manager abort message.

*Please* remember to replace this text block with your *actual* issue-post text.
